# deep_linking_demo

A tutorial project for deep linking with Huawei Push Kit's Custom Intents and uni_links package.

Please refer to the **[medium article](https://medium.com/huawei-developers/deep-linking-on-flutter-using-huawei-push-kits-custom-intents-958fedb7490a)** for the tutorial.

## Notes Before Building

I removed the agconnect-services.json and key.properties files for obvious reasons. Add your versions of these files (you can refer to the medium post) and then you can run the app by following commands:

Get the dependencies:

`flutter pub get`

Build&Run the application

`flutter run`
